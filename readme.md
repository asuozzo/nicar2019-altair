# Data Visualization With Altair
### Code and resources from the NICAR 2019 session

#### How to install
Fork or clone this repo to your computer. Make sure you have Python 3 and [Pipenv](LINK) installed on your computer.

Open this folder in your terminal and run `pipenv install`. This may take a few minutes â€” among other things, it will install Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter, Jupyter Lab and, of course, Altair.

Once that's done, run `pipenv shell` and then `jupyter lab`. This should open up in your browser.

*(Note: You should also be able to run this in a standard `jupyter notebook`, but I haven't tested it there.)*

#### Exploring the data
The project data is in the `data` directory. You can open the files right inside Jupyter Lab and check out how they're structured, or load them into your notebook with Pandas; the data definitions and sources are listed in that directory's readme.

#### Running the code
Open up the `fun-with-altair.ipynb` file. That's your working file; it's got all the libraries you'll need, the dataset imports and the prompts for what you'll do each step of the way. Run cells by hitting `shift-enter`. Try to follow the prompts by looking at the Altair documentation and Googling. If you get stuck, I give you permission to open the `fun-with-altair-SOLUTIONS.ipynb` notebook and peek, but try to make the charts before you do that!
